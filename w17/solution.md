# Solution
I would solve this challenge by adding a checkbox that asks the user if they own both appliances, and if checked, perform the calculation twice, if unchecked, peform calculation only once. So all in all, I would:
1. Add an input select asking user initial question
2. After step one is complete, a checkbox would appear asking if user owns both appliances
3. Perform calculation
