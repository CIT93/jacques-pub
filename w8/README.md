# My understanding
I understand what's going on. We're using a form to intake inputted information from a user about their home size and the amount house members in their home. With this info, I'm able to calculate it and provide the user their Carbon Footprint. Behind the scenes, theres a function whose listening to hear of any events being triggered by an action, in our case, that action is the submit button. When the form is submitted, the data gets uploaded to said listening function and it will then parse that data into text for elements we will create on the fly and append to our linked document. This process takes less than 3 seconds to occur, but we put in lots of work that took longer than that. The beauty of code!

I do not have any feedback. I've also decided that I may reset my custom work and revert back to just following what you have and keep my work in a seperate file.

## Update data
How we can update data is we can use a tenary operator to switch between edit mode or view mode. if in view, it shows the value and if in edit mode, shows an input.. it can be a lot of work but will be worth it on how cool it will look like!
